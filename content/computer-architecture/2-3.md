**CPU, register, and memory**
- Control unit (CU) directs the operation of the processor
- Arithmetic & logic unit (ALU) does the operation
- `$0, ..., $31` hold the value that will be used in the operation (called general purpose register)
- Program counter (PC) contains the memory address of the instruction will be executed
- Instruction register (IR) contains the current instruction

**Execution of the instruction**
- Step 1 (fetch): CU says "load the instruction from the memory address in PC to IR"
- Step 2 (decode): CU says "the instruction stored in IR means `ADD $s0, $s1, $s2`
- Step 2 (execute): ALU does the add operation with the values in `$s1` and `$s2` and stores the computation result in `$s0`

## Operation
### Arithmetic operations
**Instructions for arithmetic**
| Operation | C    | Java | MIPS assembly language | Example           |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Add       | +    | +    | `add` (R), `addi` (I)      | `add $t0, $t1, $t2` |
| Subtract  | -    | -    | `sub` (R)                | `sub $t0, $t1, $t2` |

### Logical operations
**Instructions for bitwise manipulation**
| Operation | C    | Java | MIPS assembly language | Example           |
| --------- | ---- | ---- | ---------------------- | ----------------- |
| Bitwise AND | &    | &    | `and` (R), `andi` (I)    | `and $t0, $t1, $t2` |
| Bitwise OR  | \    | \    | `or` (R), `ori` (I)      | `or $t0, $t1, $t2`  |
| Bitwise AND | ~    | ~    | `nor` (R)              | `nor $t0, $t1, $t2` |

MIPS has no NOT instruction </br>
Instead, it has **NOR R-type** instruction
- a NOR b == NOT (a OR b)
- But, we can do the NOT operation with NOR: `nor $t0, $t1, $zero`

### Shift operations
| Operation   | C    | Java | MIPS assembly language | Example                            |
| ----------- | ---- | ---- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Shift left  | <<   | <<<  | `sll` (R)                | `sll $s1, $s2, 10 ($s1 = $s2 << 10)` |
| Shift right | >>   | >>>  | `srl` (R)                | `srl $s1, $s2, 10 ($s1 = $s2 >> 10)` |

- shamt: how many positions to shift
- Shift left/right logical (sll / srl)
    - Shift left/right and fill with 0 bits
    - (unsigned only) sll with i bits = multiply by $2^i$
    - (unsigned only) srl with i bits = divide by $2^i$

### Conditional operations
**Instructions for making decisions** </br>
Usually combined with goto statements and labels
