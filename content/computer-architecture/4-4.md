Because the longest delay determines clock period, a single-cycle implementation is not used today <br>
It violates **"make the common case fast"**

## Pipelining overview
With the pipelined approach, the speed up can be equal to the number of stages in an ideal case
- A single task is divided into N stages
- Each stage takes teh same amount of time T
- There are M tasks, where M is large enough

To complete all the tasks
- In non-pipelined approach, we need $N \times M \times T$ times
- In pipelined approach, we need $(N + M - 1) \times T \approx M \times T$ time

$$
Time\;between\;tasks_{pipelined} = \frac{Time\;between\;tasks_{non-pipelined}}{Number\;of\;pipeline\;stages}
$$
<br>

### Stage in pipeline
For different stages, different resources are used.
- Stage 1: IF (Fetching an instruction from memory)
- Stage 2: ID (Decoding the instruction and read registers)
- Stage 3: EX (Executing operation or calculating address)
- Stage 4: MEM (Accessing data in data memory)
- Stage 5: wB (Writing the result back into a register)
<br>

### Compared to the single-cycle processor
Compared to the single cycle processor, **clock period in pipelined processor is determined by the longest stage time.**

$$
Time\;between\;instructions_{pipelined}= the\;longest\;stage\;time \times (the\;number\;of\;instructions + the\;number\;of\;stages - 1)
$$

**If there are a lot of instructions to be executed,**
$$
Time\;between\;instructions_{pipelined} = \frac{Time\;between\;instructions_{non-pipelined}}{\frac{the\;longest\;instruction\;time}{the\;longest\;stage\;time}}
$$

## Hazards in Pipelining
- Structural hazards
    - When a required resources is busy
- Data hazards
    - When we need to wait for previous instruction to complete its data read/write operation
- Control hazards
    - When we need to make a control decision differently depending on the previous instruction

### Structural hazards
When a required resource is already used for executing an other instruction
- IF and MEM stages can request to use the same resource at the same time
- it is required to separate instruction / data memories
    - IF and MEM stages use different part of memory (instruction memory, data memory)
