## Memory hierarchy
### Locality
- **Temporal locality**
    - Items accessed recently are likely to be accessed again soon
- **Spatial locality**
    - Items near those accessed recently are likely to be accessed soon
<br>

## Memory structure
- **SRAM** (cache memory attached to CPU)
    - Fastest (o.5ns ~ 2.5ns)
    - most expensive 
    - smallest
- **DRAM** (main memory)
    - Faster (50ns ~ 70ns)
    - more expensive
    - smaller
- **Disk** (HDD, SSD)
    - Slowest (5ms ~ 20ms)
    - cheapest
    - largest
<br>

### Use hierarchy
- Copy recently accessed (and nearby) items from disk to smaller DRAM memory
- Copy more recently accessed (and nearby) items from DRAM to smaller SRAM memory


**Soon will be updated!**
