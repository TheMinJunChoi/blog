## Integrating TLB, Cache, Memory
### Aliasing in virtually addressed cache
- The same virtual address of different processes can be mapped to different physical address
    - Wrong cache hit can occur
- Different virtual addresses of different process can be mapped to the same physical address <br>(when some memory space is shared by multiple processes)
    - The physical memory can be cached in two different locations
    - Coherency problem can happen <br>One program writes the data without the other program being aware that the data had changed
<br>

#### Simple solution
- Flush cache at context switching -> too high miss rate
    - Context switch: In multi-process environments, multiple processes share a single CPU
<br>

## Hybrid cache: virtually-indexed  & physically-tagged cache
- No aliasing problem
- TLB & cache are accessed in a parallel manner (fast)

- 32-bit virtual address
- Page size = $2^p$ Bytes
- Physical memory size =  $2^t$ Bytes (t-bit physical address)
- Block size = $2^m$ words
- Num of sets in a cache = $2^s$ sets

### Typical multi-level cache setup with TLB
- Typical L-1: hybrid cache (virtually-addressed, physically tagged)
    - To reduce hit time and miss rate
- Typical L-2: physically-addressed cache
    - For simple implementation
    - In addition, usually L-2 si large<br>So, because p < s + m + 2, we cannot use hybrid cache
