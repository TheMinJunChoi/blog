## Two metrics for defining computer performances
1. Response time
    - The time between the start and completion of a task
    - related to single task
    - e.g., how long it takes to do a single task
2. Throughput
    - A total amount of works done per unit time
    - related to multiple tasks
    - e.g., tasks per hour
</br>

**Q. If we replace the processor in a computer with ad faster version**
- Response time **decrease**
- Throughput **increase**

**Q. If we add more processors to a system**
- Response time **maintain or increase** (more lanes more complex)
- Throughput **increase**
</br>

## Defining performance
- Performance = 1 / execution time (response time)
- Relative performance: **X is N time faster than Y**
- $ \frac{Performance_x}{Performance_y} = \frac{Execution time_y}{Execution time_x} = N$

- Elapsed time = system performance = t1 + t2 + t3 + t4
    - total time between the start and completion of a task, **including everything**
- CPU time = CPU performance = t1 + t4 *(Only this in this class)*
    - The time spent **processing** a given task **on a processor**


$$
Performance = CPU\;performance = \frac{1}{CPU\;time}
$$

</br>

The CPU time can be further divided into
- User CPU time
    - spent for processing the code of the program (some functions)
- System CPU time
    - spent in the operating system performing tasks for the program (OS)

</br>

## Measuring CPU performance
- Clock period: the duration of a clock cycle
    - How long the computer takes to perform a single basic operation
- Clock rate (frequency): cycles per second = 1 / clock period
    - How many basic operations can be performed ins a second


$$
CPU\;time = Clock\;cycles \times Clock\;period = Clock\;cycles \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate}
$$
</br>

### What is CPI?
**Clock Cycles per instruction**</br>
: Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment </br>

$$
CPU\;time = Clock\;cycles \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate} = Instruction\;count \times CPI \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate}
$$
</br>

**CPI** can be affected by
1) Cost for each instruction type: CPI(i)
2) The frequency of each type of instructions: F(i) = Instruction count(i) / Instruction count

$$
\displaystyle CPI = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{CPI_i \times F_i}
$$
