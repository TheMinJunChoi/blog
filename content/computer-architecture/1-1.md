## Two metrics for defining computer performances
1. Response time
    - The time between the start and completion of a task
    - related to single task
    - e.g., how long it takes to do a single task
2. Throughput
    - A total amount of works done per unit time
    - related to multiple tasks
    - e.g., tasks per hour
</br>

**Q. If we replace the processor in a computer with ad faster version**
- Response time **decrease**
- Throughput **increase**

**Q. If we add more processors to a system**
- Response time **maintain or increase** (more lanes more complex)
- Throughput **increase**
</br>

## Defining performance
- $Performance = \frac{1}{execution\;time\,(reponse\;time)}$ 
- Relative performance: **X is N time faster than Y**
- $ \frac{Performance_x}{Performance_y} = \frac{Execution time_y}{Execution time_x} = N$

- Elapsed time = system performance = **t1 + t2 + t3 + t4**
    - total time between the start and completion of a task, **including everything**
- CPU time = CPU performance = **t1 + t4** *(Only this in this class)*
    - The time spent **processing** a given task **on a processor**


$$
Performance = CPU\;performance = \frac{1}{CPU\;time}
$$

</br>

The CPU time can be further divided into
- **User CPU time**
    - spent for processing the code of the program (some functions)
- **System CPU time**
    - spent in the operating system performing tasks for the program (OS)

</br>

## Measuring CPU performance
- Clock period: the duration of a clock cycle
    - How long the computer takes to perform a single basic operation
- Clock rate (frequency): $cycles\;per\;second = \frac{1}{clock\;period}$
    - How many basic operations can be performed in a second


$$
CPU\;time = Clock\;cycles \times Clock\;period = Clock\;cycles \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate}
$$
</br>

### What is CPI?
**Clock Cycles per instruction**</br>
: Average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment </br>

$$
CPU\;time = Clock\;cycles \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate} = Instruction\;count \times CPI \times \frac{1}{Clock\;rate}
$$
</br>

**CPI** can be affected by
1) Cost for each instruction type: $CPI_i$
2) The frequency of each type of instructions: $F_i = \frac{Instruction count_i}{Instruction count}$

$$
\displaystyle CPI = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{CPI_i \times F_i}
$$

### Benchmark
: **a tool for measuring the performance of computers**
- Metric: **Geometric Mean**

$$
 Performance = \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n}{Execution\;time\;ratio_i}}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt[n]{\prod_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{Execution\;time_{X,i}}{Execution\;time_{REF,i}}}}} = \sqrt[n]{\textstyle \prod_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{Execution\;time_{REF,i}}{Execution\;time_{X,i}}}}
$$

### Amdahl's law
$Execution\;time\;after\;improvement$ </br></br>
$= \frac{Execution\;time\;affected\;by\;improvement}{Amount\;of\;improvement} + Execution\;time\;unaffected$
