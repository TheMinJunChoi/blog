### Two metrics for defining computer performances
1. Response time
    - The time between the start and completion of a task
    - related to single task
    - e.g., how long it takes to do a single task
2. Throughput
    - A total amount of works done per unit time
    - related to multiple tasks
    - e.g., tasks per hour
</br>

**Q. If we replace the processor in a computer with ad faster version**
- Response time **decrease**
- Throughput **increase**

**Q. If we add more processors to a system**
- Response time **maintain or increase** (more lanes more complex)
- Throughput **increase**
</br>

### Defining performance
- Performance = 1 / execution time (response time)
