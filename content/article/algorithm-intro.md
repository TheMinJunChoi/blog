## Intro
Among the problems, I will post few ones that I am not sure, or that are difficult to solve and worth looking back later in this space.

## Whole Code
You can see my whole code in my [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/minjun0430/CodeRace).

## Notes
### All
- Running time of `a = int(input())` is longer than `a = int(sys.stdin.readline())`.
### Data Structure

### Graph
- `boj_1260` : basic DFS, BFS / getting used to it to modify as I want
- `boj_2667` : don't try to check all the graph / decide the big part first
### Binary Search
