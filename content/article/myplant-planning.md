    </p>

- __Solution__

    - MyPlant App: An app that encourages users to be interested in their plants every day.

## Direction

- Since I have focused on studying app development so far, let's focus on implementing functions first.
- Let's try to use as much as possible what I've learned about Flutter and Firebase
- The goal is not to release it but to produce prototype.

## Limits

- keep thinking about how to deal with the images storage.

  how to save vast amount of data

## Tech Stack

- Framework: Flutter
- Database: Firebase Firestorage
- UI: Figma

## Function

- sign in & sign up with firebase authentication
- Add Plants
- Daily Attendance image saving
- Showing how much users filled the attendance up
  - using tree growth algorithm?
  - or just percent
- Making a short video in the style of a flip book

## Purpose

- developing prototype
- Flutter, firebase review, and Find the next technical stack to study.
