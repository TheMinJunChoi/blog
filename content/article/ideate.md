## My Thought About Developer
As for me, developer is not just a person who code.<br>
but __a one who can solve the problem with the value of one's code.__ <br>
In that process, I thought I need to get used to focus on what the problem is, and what they truly want.

## Idea Note
This place is the page that I will write down the inconveniences or improvement I need to remember.<br>
It could be ended as Ideation,
or could be handled at <a href="https://choiminjun.com/project" target="" class="hover: underline">Project Page</a> later :)

## Problem & Idea
