## Intention
- __Problematic situation.__
    1. Separation of the fitness trainer's work space
        - Members must be managed even during external times.
        - It needs to take care of all member's scheduler.

    2. Repeated tasks such as diet and exercise program guidance are carried out.
        - Calories need to be calculated by diet and exercise program.

- __Solution__
    - Create a chat-based app, but create a separate page to manage schedulers, diets, and fitness programs.


## Direction
- Since I have focused on studying app development so far, let's focus on implementing functions first.
- Let's try to use as much as possible what I've learned about Flutter and Firebase
- The goal is not to release it but to produce prototype.


## Limits
- Other programs can provide chatting functions, but this time, I'm going to make it myself.
- Design elements may be insufficient because I didn't studied UI tools.


## Tech Stack
- __Flutter__
    - It plans to process Widget, Routing, and State Management with a Flutter.
- __Firebase__
    - It plans to store data on register, login, chat, etc.

## Function
- I'm going to write it down in detail later.

## Purpose
- developing prototype
- Flutter, firebase review, and Find the next technical stack to study.

## Plan
- The fourth week of February
    - Implementing login function
    - register page done

- The first week of March.
    - Implementing register function
